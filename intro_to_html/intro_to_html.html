    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chebureki is a deep-fried turnover with a filling of ground or minced meat and onions. It is made with a single round piece of dough folded over the filling in a crescent shape. 
        Chebureki is a national dish of Crimean Tatar cuisine. They are popular as snack and street food throughout Transcaucasia, Central Asia, Russia, Ukraine, Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Romania.</p>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add enough canola to cover bottom of pan. Use two skillets to speed up the process.</li>
        <li>Place a heaping tablespoon over 1/2 of the tortilla. Spread the meat over 1/2 of the tortilla, leaving about a 1-inch border.</li>
        <li>Brush water on the entire border of the tortilla; enough so you can see that it's wet, otherwise it won't seal.</li>
        <li>Press the sides together and seal with a fork. Flip the tortilla over and seal the other side with the fork as well to make sure they don't open while frying.</li>
        <li>Saut&eacute 3 minutes on each side over medium heat. You may need to adjust your heat settings (not all ranges are created equal), but they do need about 3 minutes per side to cook through. Place them between paper towels when done.</li>
        <li>They can get a little juicy inside so be careful that you don't get a lap-full of juice when taking a bite.</li>
    </ol>
